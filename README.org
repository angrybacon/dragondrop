#+TITLE: Dragon' Drop
#+AUTHOR: Mathieu Marques

This repository contains a small React playground.

Having approximately less than 24 hours of actual experience with React, this
project is a naive enterprise at making a Trello-like board. Two lists, each
container for cards, with cards being draggable with the mouse from one list to
another.
