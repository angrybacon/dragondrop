#+TITLE: Dragon' Drop
#+AUTHOR: Mathieu Marques

This repository contains a small React playground.

Having approximately less than 24 hours of actual experience with React, this
project is a naive enterprise at making a Trello-like board. Two lists, each
list being a container for cards, with said cards being draggable from one list
to another.
